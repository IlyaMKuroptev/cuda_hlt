CUDA HLT
========

Welcome to the CUDA High Level Trigger project, an attempt to provide
a full HLT1 realization on GPU.

Requisites
----------
The project requires a graphics card with CUDA support, CUDA 9.2 and a compiler supporting C++14. It also requires the developer package of `tbb`.

If you are working from a node with CVMFS and CentOS 7, we suggest the following setup:

```shell
export CPATH=/cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch/lib/lcg/releases/tbb/44_20160413-f254c/x86_64-centos7-gcc7-opt/include:$CPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch/lib/lcg/releases/tbb/44_20160413-f254c/x86_64-centos7-gcc7-opt/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
source /cvmfs/lhcb.cern.ch/lib/lcg/releases/gcc/7.3.0/x86_64-centos7/setup.sh
```

Regardless of the OS you are running on, you can check your compiler versions as follows:

```shell
$ g++ --version
g++ (GCC) 7.3.0

$ nvcc --version
Cuda compilation tools, release 9.2, V9.2.88
```

You can check your compiler standard compatibility by scrolling to the `C++14 features` chart [here](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support).

Optional: you can compile the project with ROOT. Then, trees will be filled with variables to check when running the VeloUT algorithm on x86 architecture.

<details><summary>Building and running inside Docker: (click to expand)</summary><p>

The following lines will build the code base from any computer with NVidia-Docker, assuming you are in the directory with the code checkout and want to build in `build`:

```bash
docker run --runtime=nvidia -e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 --rm -v $(pwd):/cuda_hlt -it nvidia/cuda:9.2-devel-ubuntu18.04 bash

apt update && apt install -y cmake libtbb-dev
mkdir build
cmake ..
make
```

</p></details>

Where to find input
-------------
Input from 1k events can be found here: 

minimum bias (for performance checks): /afs/cern.ch/work/d/dovombru/public/gpu_input/1kevents_minbias.tar.gz

Bs->PhiPhi (for efficiency checks): /afs/cern.ch/work/d/dovombru/public/gpu_input/1kevents_BsPhiPhi.tar.gz

How to run it
-------------

The build process doesn't differ from standard cmake projects:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

There are some cmake options to configure the build process:

   * The build type can be specified to `RelWithDebInfo`, `Release` or `Debug`, e.g. `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..`
   * The option to run the validation, on by default, can be turned off with `-DMC_CHECK=Off`.


The MC validation is a standalone version of the PrChecker, it was written by
Manuel Schiller, Rainer Schwemmer and Daniel CÃ¡mpora.

Some binary input files are included with the project for testing.
A run of the program with no arguments will let you know the basic options:

    Usage: ./cu_hlt
    -f {folder containing .bin files with VP raw bank information}
    -u {folder containing bin files with UT raw bank information}
    -i {folder containing .bin files with SciFi raw bank information}
    -g {folder containing detector configuration}
    -d {folder containing .bin files with MC truth information}
    -n {number of events to process}=0 (all)
    -o {offset of events from which to start}=0 (beginning)
    -t {number of threads / streams}=1
    -r {number of repetitions per thread / stream}=1
    -c {run checkers}=0
    -k {simplified kalman filter}=0
    -m {reserve Megabytes}=1024
    -v {verbosity}=3 (info)
    -p (print memory usage)
    -x {run algorithms on x86 architecture as well (if possible)}=0


Here are some example run options:

    # Run all input files once with the tracking validation
    ./cu_hlt -f ../input/minbias/velopix_raw/ -u ../input/minbias/ut_raw/ -g ../input/detector_configuration/ -i ../input/minbias/scifi_raw/ -d ../input/minbias/MC_info/ -c 1

    # Run a total of 1000 events, round robin over the existing ones, without tracking validation
    ./cu_hlt -f ../input/minbias/velopix_raw/ -u ../input/minbias/ut_raw/ -g ../input/detector_configuration/ -i ../input/minbias/scifi_raw/ -d ../input/minbias/MC_info/ -c 0 -n 1000

    # Run four streams, each with 4000 events, 20 repetitions
    ./cu_hlt -f ../input/minbias/velopix_raw/ -u ../input/minbias/ut_raw/ -g ../input/detector_configuration/ -i ../input/minbias/scifi_raw/ -d ../input/minbias/MC_info/ -t 4 -n 4000 -r 20 -c 0

    # Run one stream and print all memory allocations
    ./cu_hlt -f ../input/minbias/velopix_raw/ -u ../input/minbias/ut_raw/ -g ../input/detector_configuration/ -i ../input/minbias/scifi_raw/ -d ../input/minbias/MC_info/ -n 5000 -t 1 -r 1 -p

[This readme](readme_cuda_developer.md) explains how to add a new algorithm to the sequence and how to use the memory scheduler to define global memory variables for this sequence and pass on the dependencies.
